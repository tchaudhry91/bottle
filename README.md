[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=tchaudhry91_bottle&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=tchaudhry91_bottle)

Store and re-use data from unix pipes.
Use these utilities to pipe data into a common store across the network.

```bash
# Machine 1: Pipe data into the bottle
echo "Wow" | bottle-cli -m fill -i sample

# Crate stores the data

# Machine 2: Pipe data back
bottle-cli -m drain -i sample
Wow

```

This project contains two parts. A server, called `crate`, and a client, called `bottle-cli`. 

## Crate

This is the server that holds all bottles stored. The crate CLI operates with the following parameters

```bash
crate -h
Usage of crate:
  -db-file string
        Local file to store bottles in (default "crate.db")
  -grpc-addr string
        address to bind on (default "127.0.0.1:14999")
```

## Bottle-CLI

This is cli utility to interact with the crate. It uses gRPC behind the scenes. But does not enforce TLS yet! So do not use this on public networks as of now.
```
bottle-cli -h                                                                             130 â†µ
